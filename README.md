pinout.PNG is an image of the pinout of the Arduino we are using as reference

The Software folder holds all the code we used on the Arduino.
Most of it is just testing or backup ZIPs of libraries
The final code we run to use for our Project is: *Upsilon_Arduino_v1.ino*

The Hardware folder holds all the files for our PCB design
The final used schematic is: *ECE1895_Upsilon_PCB_Iteration3_FINAL.SchDoc*
